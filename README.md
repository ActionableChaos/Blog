# Blog
My-brain-on-git-and-other-bs

So to be brief I thought of a few projects I wanted to work on. 
One of my biggest issues I usually have is some sort of accountability.
You know what I mean, the whole "I'm gonna start something" then you get stuck and never touch it again.
Now I'm not saying I won't have that happen but figuring out a blog for this will give me something close to that.
More to that point it will give me a way to track progress and have a way to do stuff later when I actually have something to show for my work.

So in summary, this is a place for my ramblings, personal projects, blog and two of those were the same thing...

Anyways, welcome, nothing here is a tutorial on how to do things, any code I put here will generally be free to use.(though I would heavily suggest you don't since I cannot guarantee functionality in any reproducable manner for anything whatsoever I code)
Any words I say are my own, don't reflect the views or beliefs of any current, past or future employer and as a heads up I tend to use foul language as I progressively lose my mind working on something. 

So if you wanna laugh at me you're welcome to take a look at whatever code gets stored here as I learn different things.

Goals - short term:
Setup an arch install from scratch - Done
Use proper backups - In progress
Use i3wm and rice it - In progress
Learn functions I don't normally use cause I'm a gui baby - In progress
Customize various other aspects of the install - In progress
Collate install steps into a predefined script - In progress
Collate configurations into a reproducable script - In progress
Break things - Inevitable
Fix things - Possibly
Setup Git Pages for proper blog functionality - Reeeee
Generate scripts for various tasks:
  Updating
  Snapshots
  Backup snapshots
  Integrity checks on my system
  Startup tasks
  Application sets for different needs
Do some sort of baseline AI integrations cause I'm lonely and need to talk to something even if it's in my terminal. - yup
Make actually decent coders/devs get a chuckle - Impossible to avoid even if it's just out of cringeworthyness
#---
More to be added as they pop up

Goals - long term:
Setup proper workflow - 
Begin working with C - 
Begin working with Python -
Make stupid things - Always
Make useful things - when God stops laughing at me
