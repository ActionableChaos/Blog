            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Nerd, dork, geek, inevitably antisocial dweeb, the kid who turned into an introvert when they got old enough to not be cute enough to fit the term shy.
            Whatever you'd like to call me I'm me, I'm not putting my name to this project yet and yeah that's about it.
            <br>
            <br>
            Oh you want more? Sure, average linux enjoyer, pro-procrastinator and code ignoramus.
            <br>
            <br>
            Yes, this entire page just about was not coded by me and I won't claim credit for it, that belongs to the lord and savior ChatGPT.
            Why? Because I did not feel like trying to re-learn CSS and HTML in full. I'd much rather tweak a template and rather than worrying if the template I use is free I'd rather just go with something AI generated which defaults to the user last I checked. I'm boned if that isn't the case.<br>
            "But there are jekyll themes!" yeah yeah, I'll touch those eventually.

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <p>Behold! My shitty stuff.
                Yeah, not a lot here.
                <br><br>
                But what is here?<br><br>
                The reason I ended up here to begin with.<br><br>
                <p style="font-weight: bold;">Arch linux!</p>
                <pre>Project details:<br>
                Work towards a better understanding of linux overall with a focus on management and customization.<br>
                Work on linux scripting for automation and... stuff. Never said the details would be great.<br>
                Actually make myself semi proficient in the things I think I should be for how long I've used linux.<br>
                Generate scripts to reproduce my setup for myself in the future.<br>
                More to be added once I reach that point.<br>
                </pre>

                <p style="font-weight:bold;">CSS-HTML Practice</p>
                <p>
                Github Pages is really a solid little host platform for what I plan on doing. Comes with a caveat though.<br>
                I actuall have to touch HTML and CSS...<br>
                Now while I'm not new to this, I actually spent a few years when I was much younger playing with it quite a bit I'm not sure if I enjoy it.<br>
                To that end I really only touch it about as much as necessary which recently has been almost no interaction, up till I decided I wanted to blog my projects.<br>
                Now I am here figuring out divs, id's, traits, inheritence and how to get ChatGPT to fix things for me or just make things I don't wanna bother learning about. Of course in the process I'm learning about them but not how to do them which is fine by me.<br>

                <pre>Anyways heres the details:<br>
                Create super shitty webpages.<br>
                Try to make those super shitty webpages usable to at least myself.<br>
                Focus on function over form, does it do what I want? It's good to go to prod.<br>
                Tweak bits till I can stand to look at it.<br>
                Fight ChatGPT every step of the way when it breaks something because I wanted a feature.<br>
                Scream at my screen cause of conditional formatting being a thing that causes me no end of pain.<br>
                </pre>
