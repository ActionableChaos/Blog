        <h2>CSS and HTML are made to frustrate - Prove me wrong</h2>
        <p>
        My not so deep dive into HTML and CSS, this is a pain point for me since I didn't plan on actually coding my website but I'm not about to try and learn a tool to do it when I can learn to do it. Or at least learn enough to make something half workable then have ChatGPT fill my holes... the holes in my code. LVP - Least viable pieceofgarbage.

        <h2>Trying to solve depression - The Arch way</h2>
        <p>
        The holy grail of "why are you the way that you are?" mixed with "are you okay bro?" cause the answer to both questions is a resounding <b>help.</b><br><br>
        My dive into the world of Arch linux, again, but doing it right for the most part. <br>
        Project goals are pretty straight forward but how I get to them definitely isn't. I take the ADHD approach, hyperfixate till my brain hurts then find something shiny to look at for a week and come back to something else unrelated.<br>
